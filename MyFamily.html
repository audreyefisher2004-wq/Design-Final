    <p>Meet the Fisher's: Ray, Debbie, Audrey (me), Alex, and Ruby. Ray and Debbie met as children but got married in 2011 whenever Audrey was 8. They then had one child together a few years later, Alex, in 2014. Many years later after their dog died they got a new puppy named Ruby. She was the final piece to the family.</p>
