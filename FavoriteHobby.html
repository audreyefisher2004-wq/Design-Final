<div class="hobby-intro-text">
<p>This semester I took an intro to photography class during the first time. While completing this class I learned that I love capturing moments of my loved ones and of the world around me. Since this class, I have started my own photography page and have begun taking pictures of many different things. I have done photos of cars, people, racing, and dogs. Next, I would like to try doing some seasonal photos of people and animals. I look forward to see where this new hobby journey takes me!</p>
